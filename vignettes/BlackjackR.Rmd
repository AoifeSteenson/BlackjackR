## Introduction
BlackjackR is an R package which simulates a game of blackjack. In this package, a deck may be created, drawn, and printed. In addition, a value count can be done where all of the elements in a card class can be summed.   


## How to install BlackjackR
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("BlackjackR")
devtools::install_github('AoifeSteenson/BlackjackR')
```

After installation, the library must be loaded: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(BlackjackR)
```

The functions in BlackjackR include create_deck, draw_card, print_card, and count values. 

create_deck creates a deck of 52 cards that are in a random order.
